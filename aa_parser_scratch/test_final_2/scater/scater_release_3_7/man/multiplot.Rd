\title{Multiple plot function for ggplot2 plots}
\usage{
multiplot(..., plotlist = NULL, cols = 1, layout = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more ggplot objects.}

\item{plotlist}{A list of ggplot objects, as an alternative to \code{...}.}

\item{cols}{A numeric scalar giving the number of columns in the layout.}

\item{layout}{A matrix specifying the layout. 
If present, \code{cols} is ignored.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Place multiple \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} plots on one page.
}
\details{
If the layout is something like  \code{matrix(c(1,2,3,3), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)}, then:
\itemize{
\item plot 1 will go in the upper left;
\item plot 2 will go in the upper right;
\item and plot 3 will go all the way across the bottom.
}
There is no way to tweak the relative heights or widths of the plots with this simple function.

\examples{
library(ggplot2)

## This example uses the ChickWeight dataset, which comes with ggplot2
## First plot
p1 <- ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet, group = Chick)) +
   geom_line() +
   ggtitle("Growth curve for individual chicks")
## Second plot
p2 <- ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
   geom_point(alpha = .3) +
   geom_smooth(alpha = .2, size = 1) +
   ggtitle("Fitted growth curve per diet")

## Third plot
p3 <- ggplot(subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21), aes(x = weight, colour = Diet)) +
   geom_density() +
   ggtitle("Final weight, by diet")
## Fourth plot
p4 <- ggplot(subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21), aes(x = weight, fill = Diet)) +
    geom_histogram(colour = "black", binwidth = 50) +
   facet_grid(Diet ~ .) +
   ggtitle("Final weight, by diet") +
   theme(legend.position = "none")        # No legend (redundant in this graph)

## Combine plots and display
multiplot(p1, p2, p3, p4, cols = 2)
